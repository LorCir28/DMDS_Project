IMPORT DB:

- first approach:
	* each tuple modeled as a node
	* each relationship between entities is modeled as an edge
	* from original db, capital is an attribute: then it is modeled as a property but this can be conceptually wrong

- second approach:
	* remove the property 'Capital' and add another edge 'HAS_CAPITAL' not present in ER
	* it connects each country node to the corresponding capital in city node 
	* useful for our new queries wrt SQL

- DB problem for second approach:
	* PROB 1: not all capitals appear as tuples in city table -> 58 capitals not in cities
	* eg: Country tuple 'Turkey' has Attribute capital=Ankara, but tuple Ankara doesn't exist in Cities table
	* PROB 2: in db there are cities with same name: there could result multiple edges for a single country
	* eg: Country Jamaica has capital=Kingston, but there are 3 Kingston cities in Jamaica

- procedures for second approach:
	* create City nodes and edges for all capitals (58) that don't appear in cities table (solve prob 1)
	* create HAS_CAPITAL for all the other capital that were already present as City nodes
	* if for a country there are multiple cities with same name of the capital, edge is created only for one of them
