PASS FROM A SQL DB TO A GRAPH DB


It is convenient to pass from a sql db to a graph db if:
- there are many relationships between tables in the sql db
- there are only binary relationships in the sql db
- there are not many nodes not involved in relationships in the translated graph db

Rules to follow to do the transformation from sql db to graph db:
- Ideally each foreign key beacomes an edge
- a table can be either a node or an edge (it is preferable to represent it as an edge):
	- it is a node if it represents an entity that can stand alone
	- it is an edge if it links two entities
